# BarberQ Website (Frontend)

This is the website frontend for the BarberQ queue management system, built with React. It connects to the BarberQ backend API for authentication, queue management, and role-based access.

## Features
- Modern, responsive website (not a native app)
- Login, registration, and dashboard for customers, barbers, and admins
- Role-based navigation and features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer recommended)
- Backend API running (see main project README)

### Setup
1. Open a terminal and navigate to this directory:
   ```sh
   cd barberq-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the website:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage
- Use the navigation bar to access Home, Login, Register, and Dashboard.
- After login, you will see a dashboard tailored to your role.
- All features are accessible via the websiteâ€”no installation required.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about Node.js or Deno, make sure you have Node.js installed and the Deno extension is disabled in VS Code.
- If the backend is not running, login/register will not work.
